## Project Overview <a name="overview"></a>

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful and capable of generating creative content, they can produce outdated or incorrect information as they are trained on static data. To overcome this limitation, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems can be used to connect the LLM to external data and obtain more reliable answers.

The aim of this project is to build a RAG chatbot in Langchain powered by [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/overview), [Google Generative AI](https://ai.google.dev/?hl=en) and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) **APIs**. You can upload documents in txt, pdf, CSV, or docx formats and chat with your data. Relevant documents will be retrieved and sent to the LLM along with your follow-up questions for accurate answers.

Throughout this project, we examined each component of the RAG system from document loader to conversational retrieval chain. Additionally, we developed a user interface using [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) application.
